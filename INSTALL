The following lines should do the work :
$ cd espctag-x.x
$ mkdir build;cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
# make install

This will build the project in the build subdirectory.
By default the install prefix is /usr/local. Use "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=anywhere" to install in another directory.
You can choose build type using "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel".
You must have libspctag installed to successfully compile espctag. See (http://git.emor3j.fr.eu.org/web/?p=libspctag;a=summary).

Compilation has only been tested with cmake 2.8.5 on Linux. I think it works with a 2.6, this is why cmake 2.6 is required in the CMakeList.txt. Tell me if it works with older versions.


If you can not or don't want use cmake, you can use following commands to compile espctag
$ cd src
$ gcc -Wall -o espctag espctag.c -lspctag
